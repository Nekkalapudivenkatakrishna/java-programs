WAP to input basic salary of an employee and calculate its Gross     salary according to following:
    Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80%
    Basic Salary <= 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90%
    Basic Salary > 20000 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%

Write a program that prompts the user to enter their weight in pounds
 and their height in inches, and then calculates their body mass index (BMI). 
The program should then output whether they are
 underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their BMI.
